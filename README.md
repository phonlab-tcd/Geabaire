# openaac_viewer

This repository contains a rough-and-dirty alternate implementation of the OpenAAC/Coughdrop [Open Board Format](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Bnl5neOf9-y53yOAGjd8BzQ7jvAdLhcB6y9Zw7ITYbA/edit#) for alternative and augmentative communication (AAC) users. It consists of a mobile (expo/react native) application with which the user can use their Open Board Format-compliant boards with a custom or system available synthesisers. 

It is being designed for a hybrid online-offline approach, where (dependent on availablity) synthesisers, and checks are implemented.
